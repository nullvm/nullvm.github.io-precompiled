Minecraft is a sandbox game where you can craft things, mine caves, cook food
and basically any other stuff almost with no rules. There is no rules in the game
as in what the player is supposed to do.

Of course you can beat the Ender Dragon and get the credit but it's not the end of
the game.

As someone who enjoyed good story, character development, and world building in games
or books, I find it difficult to enjoy games like Minecraft since the game doesn't
tell you what you need to do.

So here I will start my journey on playing Minecraft and see if I can get to the end
and beat the ender dragon.

This is going to be very slow since I'm just a casual player.

Let's load the world and start our journey.

My first goal is:

- Get wood
- Build base
- Get bed

Oh I'm playing in version 1.21.8

I'm spawned in the middle of the forest. I gather some wood, make pickaxe and mine
some cobblestone. After that I hunt some pigs for food. I start walking in search
of sheep so that I can make bed.

Unfortunately the night come before I can find any sheep so I resort to building this
small underground base for now. Spending the first night in a cramped space.

I will go and try to search for sheep or village next day.
