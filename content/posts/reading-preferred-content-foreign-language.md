When I first started learning languages, I realized something important: it’s not really about memorizing grammar rules.

A language is just a tool. Its purpose is communication. And like any tool, the best way to learn how to use it is by watching how the experts — native speakers — actually use it.

For example, you can’t just copy English sentence structures when speaking Japanese. The meaning might survive, but it will sound completely unnatural. Each language has its own “design patterns.”



## My Story

I’m not a native English speaker. I first studied English in elementary school, and for years it was just endless grammar drills and vocabulary lists.

The goal wasn’t fluency. It was just getting good grades.

After twelve years of “studying,” I still couldn’t hold a simple conversation in English. I knew a lot of words, but I had no idea how to actually *use* them.

That’s when desperation hit. I wanted to really learn.



## The Programming Connection

Around the same time, I got into programming. At first, I studied programming in my native language. But soon I realized all the newest tutorials, docs, and frameworks were in English.

If I wanted to stay current, I had no choice: I had to learn both programming *and* English — together.



## Consuming English Media

It started with documentation and tutorials. Then walkthroughs, memes, videos, and forums.

Without noticing it, I was immersing myself in English every single day.

And slowly, things clicked.

Now I can write blog posts like this one in English. Sure, my English is still imperfect, but it works. And that’s the point.



## Why This Works

Learning only grammar and vocabulary is like memorizing syntax without ever writing code.

You don’t really *get* it until you use it in real situations.

Consuming media in your target language makes the process less intimidating. You’ll see how native speakers bend the rules, use shortcuts, or even make mistakes — and yet they still understand each other.

That’s when you realize: communication matters more than perfection.


## Advice

If you’re learning a new language, dive into the content you love.

Read docs. Watch videos. Join communities. Play games. Even scroll memes.

At first, you’ll feel lost. That’s normal. But confusion is part of the process.

Eventually, things start making sense. And that “click” moment feels way better than having a teacher just hand you a grammar rule.
