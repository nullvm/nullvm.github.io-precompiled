Well, hello there! My name is Deni Andrian Prayoga, also known as nullvm. I'm just a
regular man who loves building stuff and solving problems using mathematics
and programming. You'll find my thoughts about mathematics, programming,
and human languages in this website, whenever I have idea about
those stuff, I will post it here. You can mail me at [deniandriancode@gmail.com](mailto:deniandriancode@gmail.com).

Enjoy your stay.
