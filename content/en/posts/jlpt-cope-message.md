## Struggle in Studying for JLPT Exam

First off, let's address the emotional aspect: feeling unworthy or discouraged while studying a new language is completely normal, especially with a complex language like Japanese. The JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test) is challenging, and many learners struggle with reading comprehension and sentence construction. However, this doesn't reflect your worth or capabilities. Language learning is a journey that involves perseverance, and the fact that you're taking on this challenge is commendable!

Now, let's break down some strategies and resources that can help make studying for the JLPT more manageable and effective:

### Strategies for Studying Reading Comprehension:

1. **Start with Simplified Materials**:
   - Begin with reading materials that match your current proficiency level. Graded readers or JLPT-specific practice books can be a great start.
   - Websites like NHK Easy News provide news articles in simplified Japanese, making it easier to build comprehension gradually.

2. **Active Reading Techniques**:
   - **Annotate Texts**: As you read, highlight or underline unfamiliar words and phrases. Write notes in the margins to summarize paragraphs or sections.
   - **Summarize**: After reading a passage, try to summarize it in your own words, either in Japanese or in your native language.
   - **Ask Questions**: As you read, ask yourself questions about the text to improve engagement and understanding. For example, "Who is the main character?" or "What is the author's main point?"

3. **Increase Exposure to Different Texts**:
   - Diversify your reading materials. Read articles, stories, and essays on various topics to get used to different writing styles and vocabulary.
   - Websites like Satori Reader and WaniKani provide reading materials with built-in language learning tools.

4. **Build Vocabulary Gradually**:
   - Focus on vocabulary lists specific to your JLPT level. Use apps like Anki or Memrise to create flashcards for frequent review.
   - Incorporate new vocabulary into sentences and practice them regularly.

5. **Practice with Past Exams**:
   - Practice reading comprehension with past JLPT papers or mock tests. Familiarizing yourself with the test format can reduce anxiety and improve performance.

### Tips for Building Sentences in Japanese:

1. **Understand Basic Grammar Structures**:
   - Master the fundamental sentence structures and particles in Japanese. Resources like Tae Kim’s Guide to Japanese Grammar or Genki textbooks are great for this.
   - Practice constructing simple sentences and gradually increase complexity.

2. **Practice Sentence Patterns**:
   - Memorize common sentence patterns and use them as templates. For example, patterns for expressing opinions, describing actions, or giving reasons.
   - Use tools like Bunpro, which focuses on grammar and sentence construction through spaced repetition.

3. **Use Language Exchange and Speaking Practice**:
   - Engage in language exchange with native speakers. Platforms like HelloTalk or Tandem can connect you with Japanese speakers who want to learn your language.
   - Practice speaking and constructing sentences in real-time, which can significantly improve your fluency and confidence.

4. **Write Regularly**:
   - Keep a diary or journal in Japanese. Start with simple sentences and gradually incorporate new vocabulary and grammar points.
   - Participate in online forums or communities where you can write and receive feedback. Lang-8 or HiNative are platforms where you can get corrections from native speakers.

5. **Study with Audio and Visual Aids**:
   - Listen to Japanese podcasts, watch dramas, or use apps like FluentU, which provide context and examples for new words and phrases.
   - Mimic native speakers to improve your intonation and sentence flow.

### Mindset and Motivation:

1. **Set Realistic Goals**:
   - Break down your study plan into manageable goals. Instead of "I need to pass the JLPT N3," focus on smaller, achievable targets like "I will learn 10 new words this week."

2. **Track Your Progress**:
   - Keep a log of what you’ve learned and the areas where you’ve improved. This can be motivating and help you see tangible progress over time.

3. **Stay Positive and Persistent**:
   - Remember, everyone learns at their own pace. Comparing yourself to others can be discouraging. Celebrate your successes, no matter how small.

4. **Connect with Other Learners**:
   - Join study groups or online communities for JLPT preparation. Sharing experiences and tips with fellow learners can provide encouragement and practical advice.
