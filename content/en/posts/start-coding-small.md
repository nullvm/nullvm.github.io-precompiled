If you are learning programming or computer science related stuff,
chances are you will write some code. Coding and programming are two
different things, in a nutshell, programming is applying some logic 
while coding is actually typing the applied logic into machine-readable
instruction, read [this awesome article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/difference-between-coding-and-programming/)
from freeCodeCamp.

You can do programming wherever you are, you don't have to sit in
front of your computer since applying some logic don't necessarily
need a computer.Think about how you study math, that's how you study
programming, more or less.

Studying coding, on the other hand, requires you to be in front of
your computer and type some code. Now, no matter how much you love
programming and coding, you still have to leave your computer, you
got other things to do and booting up your computer just to be able
to study code might feel a bit of a hassle.

Learning programming is important but if you can't implement what
you have learnt, it is practically useless, in other word, you just
waste your time. That's why you also need to learn how to code, learn
how to make you logic become reality and solve real world problems.

Booting up a computer just to typing some confusing text and make
your brain hurt doesn't sound very fun, that's being said, in this
article I want to share with you, how you can learn coding while
making it fun, or at least making coding less of a hassle.

## Meaningless Things and Why It's Actually Good

What I mean with meaningless here is things that are not exciting
to do, it could be anything from doing daily habits to working on
the same problem multiple times.

For example, when you are hungry, you search for something to eat,
maybe you go to the kitchen and start making something or just order 
it using online service, in the end you have something to eat and 
start devouring it to satisfy your hunger.

Searching for food when we are hungry is an activity we do in daily
basis, we do it so often that sometimes we didn't think about it too
much, hungry means search for food to eat, done, there is no excitement
in doing such activity since we do it everydayâ€”unless if we are visiting
a restaurant then it's a different story.

When we do such activity without all of this emotional attributes, we actually
using less energy satisfy our need, since we just focus on doing the activity,
our body will use the energy to complete such task and not using it to other
things like the feeling of excitement.

In other word, meaningless things are just things we do automatically we
didn't give it much attention since we didn't really have to. Because, as you
can tell, giving attention to something is using a lot of energy.

## The More Often You Do Something, The More It Becomes Part of Your Life

As long as I can remember, I never washed my dish after I use it. Unless
my parents told me to do so, washing my own dish has never been in my
mind. I feel burdened when I have to wash my own dish despite the simplicity
of the task, until I got into highschool and realize that I need to start
doing things on my own since I will soon become an adult.

On my mind, onee of the task that I need to start doing it on my own is 
washing my own dish. So I start washing my own dish as soon as I finished
my meal. For the first few times it feels unnatural and something that I
should not be doing, but I keep telling myself that if I can't do this simple
thing on my own, I won't be able to live by myself.

Since then, everytime I finished my meal, I wash the dish almost instantenously.
Days turned into weeks, weeks turned into months, and now anytime I finished
my meal, if I don't wash the dish I feel something is missing, washing my dish
has been part of my identity, it is something I can't miss in my life.

Washing my own dish has turned from being something unnatural for me into
something I can't live without, all of that because of how often I do that
activity, the more I do it the more I convince myself that this is the right
thing to do, that this is part of myself I can't miss.

Coding is not very different, it may be something unnatural for you now, however
if you keep doing it in daily basis, it will eventually become part of yourself.
When something has become part of yourself, you will do it voluntarily without
any burden.

## Excitement is Burden for Your Brain

Excitement and motivation sounds like a good thing especially when doing something
new, well, it is, but without proper management of this _burst of energy_, it will
backfires you.

Usually, poor management of excitement or motivation will cause the following pattern:

1. Motivation kicks in
2. You start doing what your motivation told to do
3. You do it until you tired
4. Motivation fades
5. You lost interest on doing it again
6. You abandon it

At least, that's what happen to me, a lot.

I experience this because when I have the motivation, I have this mindset on my brain
that tells me "keep going, just one more thing" everytime I want to rest, and since
I don't know when I will have this kind of motivation I follow it and endup burning
out my energy.

## Start Small

In the previos paragraphs, I tell you that you need to something, in this case coding,
a lot to make it to be part of yourself, but then I told you that doing things a lot
will cause burnout and makes you abandon your work, isn't that counterintuitive? Well,
not really, not if you start small.

How small is small enough? The answer is the smallest possible, it is impossible you
can't do it. Take coding for example, how small of coding is the smallest possible?
If you open up your text editor or IDE, and then you start typing out codes from, say,
stackoverflow, that's enough, at least for me.

Is it ridiculous? Yes, perhaps, but as long as you open your text editor and writing
some code, that's good enough. You are not trying to build the next Facebook or Google,
what you are trying to build is the mentality that coding is part of yourself, so start
as small as possible, as long as you write some code on daily basis, that's good enough.
One of the key thing here is to lower you expectation. It may looks unnecessary because
of how simple the task you need to do, but just keep doing it, until it becomes natural.

## Keep Things in Line

The idea of start small is to make coding a habit, something that attached to your
identity, I keep saying your identity or yourself and not you life because when something
becomes part of yourself, it is something that you believe that it's the right thing
to do, when you do something you believe is right you will put effort to make it happen.

Start coding from small amount helps you to make it something you do in daily basis,
we often forget something we do rarely, to make coding sticks, you have to do it often
enough you can't forget about it.

## Afterword

Coding is more to physical activity in a sense that the main focus is to apply the concept
you learned in programming into real world code. There are many ways to make coding a
fun activity, what I mention above is just my opinion. If you have other methods that works
for you to make coding fun, use that instead, everyone has their own method of approaching
coding, choose the one that works for you.

That's it for now, I'll see you on another post.

Stay safe.
