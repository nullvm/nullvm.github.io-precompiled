### Overview
Algorithm Analysis is a fundamental course that focuses on the principles and techniques used to evaluate the efficiency and performance of algorithms. This course will equip students with the skills to analyze and compare the computational complexity of different algorithms and understand the trade-offs in time, space, and other resources.

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs).
- Familiarity with common algorithms (sorting, searching, etc.).
- Proficiency in at least one programming language (preferably Python, Java, or C++).
- Basic knowledge of discrete mathematics and computer science concepts.

### Course Objectives
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
1. Understand and apply Big O, Big Θ, and Big Ω notations.
2. Analyze the time and space complexity of various algorithms.
3. Compare and contrast different algorithms based on their performance.
4. Design efficient algorithms and optimize existing ones.
5. Understand the trade-offs involved in algorithm design.
6. Apply algorithm analysis techniques to solve real-world problems.
